Currently I am studying on M.B.A. program at the Loren Brusque University, graduating in 2017. I’m studying subjects that are relevant to the offered post. Moreover, I constantly perfect my management skills by taking various additional courses.

During my studies I have held the post of Junior Executive at «Hansel's Corporation» and improved my leadership skills, communication competences and ability to work in a team. While leading and supervising subordinates, I gained a valuable experience for the post of Quality Assurance Manager.

I am available for interview at any time. You can contact me most easily by the mobile phone number given above.

Thank you for your consideration of my application. I look forward to meeting you in the nearest future.

Yours sincerely,

It is an imaginary letter, so don't be afraid of inventing interview description, convenient time and other details.

Write a polite letter closing.

Model answer:
Hello Alice,

My name is Jessica Halley (Bluegill class of 2013), and I am a volunteer conducting alumni interviews for the University of Bluegill Admissions Office. You've been registered in the university system and I'm writing to set an interview with you.

The alumni interview is a relaxed, informal conversation where you can tell me something about yourself, and I can answer any questions you have about our university. The interview is optional and if you wish to cancel it, just let me know.

Ideally, we should talk sometime in the next two weeks. I am usually free during the weekends. Would Saturday, January 10th, 8pm GMT +2 work for you? If not, we can also chat the weekend after, January 17th or 18th. It will also have to be a remote interview. Can we skype? I can also call your phone if that's more convenient for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you, and thank you for your interest in Bluegill University!

Best wishes,

Jessica
